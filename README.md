# Trading-with-Momentum

Implementation of a momentum trading strategy and test if it has the potential to be profitable. I worked with historical data of a given stock universe and generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. I computed the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, I performed a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.  

The code is in the file <code>Trading with Momentum.ipynb </code>
